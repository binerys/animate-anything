				* Feet
			* Mouth
* [4 points]  Demonstrate the camera tracking a moving object using lookAt().
	* Used throughout animation 
* [6 points]  Design polygonal objects of your own. You must provide positions, normals, and texture coordinates directly, by extending the Shape class.

	* Bowl is a slightly modifed sphere 
* [2 points] For one of your custom polygonal objects, show at least one flat-shaded seam (a discontinuous edge) and light it with the Phong reflection model.
	* Strawberry on right
* [2 points] Texture one of your custom polygonal objects procedurally or by mapping an image.
	* Strawberry on left
* [2 points] Real-time speed. Make sure that your animation runs at the same speed regardless of the machine your program runs on; i.e., one simulated second corresponds roughly to one real second.
[2 points] Display the frame rate of your program on the graphics window.
